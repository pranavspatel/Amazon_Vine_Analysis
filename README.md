# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
For this project, we have been asked to pick one dataset from the Amazon Review datasets and submit it to an ETL process. We will use technologies such as Pandas, Google Colab, Jupyter notebook, PostgreSQL, AWS to mine the dataset. By doing so, we intend to meet this challenge's requirements, namely:

1 extract the dataset,
2 transform the data,
3 connect to an AWS RDS instance, and
4 load the transformed data into pgAdmin. Finally, using PySpark, Pandas, or SQL we will determine whether there 
  exists any bias toward "favorable reviews from Vine members in the chsen dataset".
